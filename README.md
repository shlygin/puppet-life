# Game of Life

Game of Life implementation as Puppet module.

## Description

This module implements Conway's Game of Life.
On each turn generates two files: 
 * /etc/life.yaml with life cells list.
 * /etc/life.txt with pseudographical game representation.

Requires Puppet >= 4.9.0 (Hiera defaults).

## Usage

### Simple autogenerated first turn

```
include life
```

This will generate Life field of 15x15 size with random cells.

### First turn with choosen field size

```
class { 'life':
  max_size_x => 15,
  max_size_y => 15
}
```

### Customizing game field

Game field can be modified by changing /etc/life.yaml file.
Structure:
```
---
field:
  x: <number of rows>
  y: <number of cells in row>
life:
  1:       # point name (used internally only)
    x: <x position of dot>
    y: <y position of dot>
  <...>
```

### Glider figure example

```
---
field:
  x: 15
  y: 15
life:
  1:
    x: 2
    y: 3
  2:
    x: 3
    y: 4
  3:
    x: 4
    y: 2
  4:
    x: 4
    y: 3
  5:
    x: 4
    y: 4
```

## Testing with Vagrant

Repository contains Vagrantfile. You can provision a box with default settings by running
``` vagrant up ```

Next turn can be made by
``` vagrant provision ```

You can check step result by SSHing to box and checking game field:
```
# vagrant ssh
# cat /etc/life.txt
```
